Building [OS agents]((https://seed-tars.com/1.5/)) at ByteDance Seed.
<!-- I got my PhD degree from the University of Hong Kong -->
<!-- at the end of 2021, affiliated with the HKU database group and [NLP group](https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/).  -->
<!-- I am advised by Prof. [Ben Kao](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/kao). -->
<!-- I am also working closely with [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/index.html).  -->
<!-- Before that, I received my B.E. degree from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/en/) in 2017.  -->
<!-- Throughout my graduate studies, I had great internships in Tencent AI Lab and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. -->

I am proceeding steadily towards a general self-improving OS agents: [OS-Copilot](https://os-copilot.github.io/), [SeeClick](https://osatlas.github.io/), [OS-Atlas](https://osatlas.github.io/), [OS-Genesis](https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/).
<!-- My research centers around large language models (LLMs) with a special focus on building the next generation of natural language interfaces that can interact with and learn from real-world environments. You can find a prototype of my ambitious goal at [OS-Copilot](https://os-copilot.github.io/) and a series of related work:  -->
